**Research Problem and Motivation:**
This research addresses a critical challenge in modern wireless networks: the scarcity of high-quality training data for machine learning models used in network traffic forecasting. Real-world network data is often subject to strict privacy regulations, proprietary restrictions, and scalability limitations, making it difficult to collect diverse and representative datasets for training ML models. The authors identify four key challenges with synthetic data generation: achieving appropriate data resemblance without overfitting, ensuring generalization capabilities to unseen scenarios, determining minimal real data requirements, and preserving privacy. The motivation stems from the need for scalable, privacy-friendly solutions that can enhance ML model performance in Wi-Fi traffic prediction while bypassing the complexities and costs of collecting large volumes of real network data.

**Methodology and Approach:**
The researchers propose a novel synthetic data generation framework based on first-order autoregressive (Gauss-Markov) noise statistics. The approach consists of three main components: (1) a feature extraction engine that derives seed knowledge from minimal real Wi-Fi data by computing statistical descriptors like temporal means and variances for each hour and day of the week, (2) a synthetic data generator that uses these statistics to create new traffic patterns through deterministic baseline patterns, independent Gaussian noise for day-of-week variability, and Gauss-Markov autoregressive noise for temporal correlation, and (3) ML models (CNN and LSTM) trained on the synthetic data for traffic prediction. The method operates with minimal real data requirements (as little as 1-15 days) while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that maintain essential temporal dependencies and cyclical behaviors of real Access Point behavior.

**Key Findings and Results:**
The experimental evaluation on a dataset of 100 Wi-Fi access points revealed several important findings. ML models trained on synthetic data achieved Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10-15% of those obtained using real data when evaluated on the same APs. More significantly, when generalization to unseen APs was required, synthetic-data-trained models improved prediction accuracy by up to 50% compared to real-data-trained baselines. The study found that LSTM models significantly outperformed CNN models when trained on synthetic data, particularly for generalization tasks (Φtest ≠ Φtrain). Statistical analysis showed that while the synthetic data didn't perfectly replicate distributional properties (with considerable variations in higher-order moments), it successfully preserved essential temporal structures and weekly patterns (achieving correlations &gt; 0.8), which proved crucial for effective traffic prediction.

**Significance and Contributions:**
This work makes several significant contributions to the field of wireless network analytics and synthetic data generation. The proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting by providing a computationally efficient alternative to complex deep generative models like GANs. The approach addresses privacy concerns by extracting only aggregate temporal and variance characteristics rather than individual user data. The research demonstrates that controlled divergence from real data can actually benefit model robustness and generalization capabilities, challenging the assumption that synthetic data must perfectly replicate real data distributions. The framework provides a scalable solution that requires significantly less training data while enabling better performance in cross-domain scenarios, making it particularly valuable for privacy-sensitive wireless networking environments.

**Limitations and Future Work:**
